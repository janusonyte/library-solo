# JavaFX + MySQL Library Project

This Library Project was created using JavaFX and connects to a MySQL database. 

The project requirements were to allow users to search stock (journals, books), borrow stock items, and return them. Users can register and log in to view their currently borrowed books and their user information, as well as borrow/return books. Admins can log access the library, view stock and who borrowed it, search stock and view library users.
